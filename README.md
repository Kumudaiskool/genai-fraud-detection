# genai-fraud-detection
# GenAI-Powered Fraud Detection Microservice ðŸš€

This project showcases a GenAI-driven microservice built to detect fraud in financial transactions using a hybrid approach:
- GPT-4 for deep reasoning
- FinBERT (Hugging Face) for sentiment analysis
- LangChain + ChromaDB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

Additionally, it includes a custom fine-tuning of BERT (using Unsloth) to recognize fraud-specific patterns and streamline claims management workflows.
